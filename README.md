# Subi Code Challenge

## Objective

1. This forms a part of the technical assessment for a candidate who is expected to code in TypeScript
2. This is a super simple exercise designed to test a candidates ability to code in TypeScript - using a TDD approach

## To Get Things Running

```
yarn
yarn test
```

## How do I get started
Please have a look at [eventEmitter.test.ts](./src/eventEmitter.test.ts)

 * You're going to build a simple basic event emitter. What is an event emitter? Put it simply, it allows calling clients to register handlers for specific events (eg a mouse click) such that when an event is emitted, each callback is invoked with the payload.
 
##  INSTRUCTIONS:
 *   1. Complete eventEmitter.ts - use the tests in (eventEmitter.test.ts) to guide you as to what to implement. Naturally,
       the tests should probably pass!
 *   2. Remember to git commit any progress (as you might with any task or work item assigned to you)
 *   3. If you have any questions - feel free to make any reasonable assumptions (and document them and why).
 
 
  Good luck!!
